AI , ML , Stats , Data Mining , many fields related analysis data often mistook one thing , thus words often used interchangeably convey one thing . true ! similarity disciplines disciplines related analysis data converting data “ information ” .In academics , learning AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining , academic approach wander technical definitions concepts underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored , case articles try explain difference . Thus , becoming primary cause confusion learners . Hence , article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines rather wandering technical definitions . difference AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining ? essential difference disciplines lies “ aims ” approach taken achieve aims.The aims fields explained detail following sections : Artificial Intelligence : aim Artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities . satisfy aim , must first understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent ? answer questions found studying intelligent agents best example intelligent agent found standing front mirror ! Yes ! Humans best examples intelligent entities . Thus , 1900s , researchers began exploring thought process , reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent . Mimicking human behavior became aim AI initial years research . setting goal , studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim Turing Test ! Turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve human-level performance cognitive tasks , sufficient fool interrogator . test received criticism mimicking human behavior exactly intelligence . intelligence related working human brain without human brain , intelligence meaning ! Thus , mimicking human thought processes reasoning became transformed aim . field Psychology philosophy also resonate aim understand human thought process . difference AI tries understand thought process mimic , build . collaboration fields resulted models Neural Networks try mimic function neurons present human brain . , basically , initial aim human-centered humans considered ideal intelligent agent.Concurrently , field computer science developing greater pace . advances computer science , experiments theories could easily tested validated . programs applied solve real-life problems , found computers performed better humans tasks really complex humans . One best examples could chess-playing program . AI program defeated world ’ best chess player Garry Kasparov . incident indicated human intelligence ultimate intelligence else human would able defeat AI program . leads question , human intelligence ideal intelligence ? computers became advanced , proved better humans certain complex tasks . new definition intelligence related ability solve cognitive tasks problems . , rather considering nature agents , researchers began study nature intelligence . question comes test validate intelligence ? best way test intelligence solve cognitive problems . agent said intelligent solve complex problem . problem-solving approach easily tested validated computers . Thus , researchers began studying ideal intelligence , selected agent validate experiments computer . , computer problem-solving approach adopted . , human-centered approach computer , problem-solving approach two main aims AI . fields contributed field giving valuable insights.Both aims important collaboratively form main aim AI ! Machine Learning : problem-solving approach , big challenge AI overcome order achieve aim . Consider example solving math problem . two cases intelligence tested problem-solving approach . Let us say two math problems given solve . first problem familiar second problem not.Consider first problem . first problem familiar , means know solve kind problems already solved similar problems past . , comes question , mind able solve problem ? answer , solved similar problems past , thus learned past data , solve problems , thus even ’ seen problem past , still able solve similar problems . one form intelligence.Consider another case given second problem solved kind problems past . solve problem , try consciously gather manipulate given information reach certain conclusion . kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process . second kind intelligence.For AI build intelligent agents , kinds intelligence must developed agent . , reality AI reached point able build agents learn past data find useful information . AI today reached point build agents think . second type intelligence.So , way AI able implement first type intelligence Machine Learning ! , domain AI focuses solely implementing first kind intelligence fact Machine Learning . reason ML called subset AI ! , main difference AI ML.Technically speaking , “ field study gives computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions , patterns without explicitly programmed ” . statement needs elaboration . essence ML related process “ Generalization ” learning past data . Generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims . Consider humans recognize daily life objects . see animal , easily recognize “ dog ” “ cat ” . trivial task us ever wondered mind able ? answer Generalization ! given picture dog , easily recognize picture dog , , minds abstracted description dog formulated “ concept ” dog concepts became better better learned past experiences dog . , way think dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds.With generalization , come real “ information ” . , try give computers ability generalize “ raw data ” convert “ information ” patterns trends data . Statistics : discipline concerns collection , organization , analysis , interpretation , presentation data . Statistics tries deal data aim explain . , study explaining data ! Statistics two main domains Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics.Descriptive statistics deals explanation description data thus name “ Descriptive ” statistics . tries explain much information possible , easily whole large data would complex task otherwise . Inferential statistics try make accurate inferences available small data . use inference many tasks daily lives . Consider simple case cooking soup . completing recipe , taste small sample , , spoonful soup check soup tastes good bad . Depending upon result sample , make inference whole soup soup whole , good bad . Similarly , statistics , cases apply inference meaningful information . example , consider case gather whole data time-consuming costly . cases , applying inference based available sample introduces uncertainty . inferential statistics come help.So , use data context uncertainty decision-making face uncertainty statistics deals . , however , whatever data , statistics tries explain data . aim resonate AI ML , statistics help fields correctly interpret data ! Data Mining : “ Data ” , useful raw form . Consider examples sensors used industrial applications . sensors might used manufacturing plant sense different properties like temperature , pressure , etc . raw data generated sensors useful unless converted suitable form , processed , analyzed gather valuable insights , used solve problem ! Due unique aim capturing essence large datasets , gather insights , Data Mining also referred “ Knowledge Discovery ” . , Carly Fiorina , former CEO Hewlett-Packard said , “ goal turn data information information Insight ” . statement completely explains aim Data Mining ! , difference AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining lies aims . approaches taken fields , help one way fulfilling aims fields . beauty fields !

Whilst made tremendous progress understanding brain activity years , research ’ able answer questions relating nature emotions experiences.HistoryBeginning within late nineteenth century , time psychological queries driven philosophical understanding mind , typically equated consciousness . result , analysis brain behavior naturally thought role consciousness behavioral management brain.The Ancient Mayans among first propose sorted feeling degree consciousness , purpose , worldly association mankind . Since consciousness incorporates stimuli nature well interior stimuli , Mayans trusted essential type existence , equipped evolution . Incas , however , thought consciousness movement mindfulness well worry others too.John Locke , early philosopher , said consciousness , individuality , freelanced substances . also detected reason believe consciousness stuck specific body mind , consciousness transferred one body mind different one . Karl Marx , another early thinker , denies mind-body classification holds consciousness jeopardized material eventualities one ’ settings . William James , American psychologist , differentiated consciousness stream – unbroken continuous despite several changes shifts.While main center lot analysis moved strictly note cable behaviors throughout primary half twentieth century , analysis human consciousness grown staggeringly 1950s.In Sigmund Freud ’ psychoanalytic theory , see believed three levels awareness- preconscious , conscious , unconscious responsible one ’ behavior thinking . believed mid divided three parts- id , ego , superego . Id present birth , instinctual , operates according pleasure principle . ego underseals reality logic develops id infancy . Finally , superego internalization society ’ moral standards responsible guilt . , Id regarded unconscious , whereas ego superego also conscious preconscious . Freud constantly revised clinical qualities researches , however , ’ conduct scientific experiments hence work heavily scrutinized , leaving questions unanswered . Sigmund Freud ’ theory differed psychologists since theories understandable easily conveyed people . Sigmund Freud ’ work hypotheses helped people shape perspectives youth , character , memory , sexuality , therapy . However , theories subject considerable criticism life . Whilst John Locke William James took practical approach mystery conducting experiments , Sigmund Freud ’ provide evidence support claims.BrainToday , essential focal point consciousness research understanding consciousness implies biologically mentally . Issues interest include phenomena perception , blindsight , brainwaves sleep , altered states consciousness produced psychoactive drugs.A greater part test assesses consciousness approaching human subjects verbal report encounters . However , confirm criticalness verbal reports , researchers must contrast action happens brain —that , search neural connections consciousness.Hope locate noticeable action specific aspect brain , particular pattern global brain activity , greatly predictive consciousness mindfulness . brain imaging strategies , example , EEG MRI scans , utilized physical proportions brain activities examinations.A investigations shown movement essential primary sensory areas brain ’ adequate create consciousness : workable subjects report absence awareness event , areas , example , primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions stimulus . Higher brain areas viewed encouraging , particularly prefrontal cortex , involved range high order functions.One mainstream theory implicates various examples brain waves creating various conditions consciousness . Analysts record mind waves , drawings electrical movement inside cerebrum , using electroencephalograph ( EEG ) placing electrodes scalp . four types brain waves ( alpha , beta , theta , delta ) correspond one mental state ( relaxed , alert , lightly asleep , deeply asleep ) MemoryEpisodic memory regarded form conscious memory . capacity consciously remember personally experienced events situations past . hippocampus located brain ’ temporal lobe responsible type memory.Consciousness also plays part important memory distinctions . One distinction implicit explicit characteristics ; explicit memory consciously know implicit memory includes events may conscious of.Furthermore , several empirical findings suggest declarative memory related consciousness well ; meaning retrieval formation memory connected awareness . Working memory operates/maintains consciously perceived information well since temporarily stores tampers information whilst working tasks.The current ways testing information lacking several essential aspects , including spatial resolution , temporal resolution , scope . Examples methods PET , fMRI , EEG , implanted electrodes , etc.PET fMRI temporal resolution problems , EEG well-known localizability difficulties , implanted electrodes whilst great temporal spatial resolution test set number neurons ; , restricted scope . Hence , huge numbers speculations , testable fundamental level , appear difficult test now.Mental illnessConsciousness influence way see objects around us , encourages us settle choices communicate . Experiencing difficulty perceiving objects connected problems , example , agnosia ( failure decipher visual data ) , Alzheimer ’ disease , autism . However , actually ’ comprehend visual data basic mind intentionally perceive object.Several different disorders consciousness include locked-in syndrome , minimally conscious state , persistent vegetative state , chronic coma , brain death.Locked-in syndrome , otherwise called pseudo coma , condition wherein patient aware however ’ move impart verbally complete loss motion essentially voluntary muscles body aside vertical eye developments squinting . individual conscious able speak eye movements.In minimally conscious state , patient intermittent periods awareness wakefulness . Patients need give restricted , however reproducible indications consciousness themself current circumstance . could following straightforward orders , comprehensible speech , purposeful conduct.In persistent vegetative state , patient sleep-wake cycles , lacks awareness , able communicate , displays reflexive non-purposeful behavior . term refers organic body able grow develop devoid intellectual activity social intercourseLike coma , chronic coma results generally cortical white-matter harm neuronal axonal injury , central brainstem sores . Usually , metabolism grey matter decreases 50-70 % normal range . patient lies eyes shut ’ know self environmental factors.Brain death irreversible end brain activity , function ( including involuntary activity necessary sustain life ) . main cause total necrosis cerebral neurons following loss brain oxygenation . brain death patient lacks sense awareness ; sleep-wake cycles behavior , typically look dead deep sleep state.Future predictions conclusionAs see history scholar ’ endeavors study consciousness empirically , nature one defined using scientific methods . past , psychologists Descartes came dualistic theories line fundamental laws physics . battle realists illusionists , taking sides fundamentally impossible topic ’ allow concrete evidence.As observe neural examinations brain detect causes consciousness , sensory sector brain cause one aware certain event even clear signs reaction stimulus . Similarly , even though consciousness plays major role memory , currently lack facilities research fully . future , possibility able access facilities , however , could allow us find neural connections ties mental illness well . would help several people making us aware causes perspective certain things , would also give us better chance recognizing signs possible mental illness issues beforehand.As seems , researchers continue study unknown part mind able fund recover global pandemic , able answer one psychology ’ difficult questions.Blackcoffer Insights 21 : Amara Arora Vaanya Kaushal , Scottish High International School",0.094,0.071,0.08212573918456273,0.37920323685029567

Aviation Tourism industries face highest stress Coronavirus spreads ( usually ) leisure spending also nature disease directly conflicts industries ’ innate business models . article , look impact COVID-19 pandemic Tourism Aviation industries demand side supply side.The Aviation Tourism industries two major customers : tourists business travellers . Let us base essay India see reaction customer segments expected like.Almost tourists avoid vacationing foreseeable future : Financial hardship : exceptionally large part world ’ working population affected financially pandemic . Unemployment rates soaring ones still job facing pay-cuts , furloughs deferment salaries.Risk contraction : disease spreads via social contact , safe vacation destination regularly sanitized crowded . Inherently , tourist destinations compliant regulations even industry makes change clean introducing social distancing measures , convincing risk averse tourists travel vacation spots difficult.Expansion alternatives ways relax : people adapt work-from-home environments , burnout rate declining . People relaxed homes people eagerly looking getaway . Combined deterrent rise alternative ways relax . people going walks , yoga finding new hobbies . Due increase pursuit happiness home , might likely tourists avoid traveling ’ feel urge break-free move away holiday.Now , let us look different types holiday revellers . Tourists foreigners domestic tourists . According Business Insider “ 2019 , almost 10 million foreign tourists visited India — spending ₹1,800 billion January November period. ” . However , pandemic , almost business lost.Due reasons stated foreigners prefer travel . dare venture , perhaps wooed discounted deals places would otherwise budgets , possibly warded one following factors : Poor quality health care India : chance tourist contracts COVID-19 , probably accustomed better healthcare system one India provides . developing country India find hard convince foreign tourists healthcare systems mark home countries.Densely populated regions around tourist destinations : tourist destinations support neighbouring economy , areas often densely populated , leads higher risk transmission COVID-19 foreign tourists cognizant fact.Moving focus domestic tourists , subdivide population according income levels : Poverty Line : people ’ travelLower Income Families : people majorly travel religious places visit family . Thus , ’ contribute aviation industry generate little revenue tourism industry prefer stay cheap lodges relative ’ place.Middle Income Families : travel year two tend avoid airplanes . Revenue tourism industry also limited subsection.Upper Middle Income Families : vacation regularly , often flying near-by holiday spots . section economy severely hit Coronavirus ’ financial hardships . People lost jobs almost everyone low liquidity . risk averse , people probably save money avoid spending vacations time . loss volumes sector affect Aviation Tourism industries severely.High Income Families : sector relatively insulated financial hardships caused Coronavirus likely spend holidays assured sanitization social distancing.In order attract well paying customers , Aviation Tourism industries spend considerable amount money become sanitation compliant push profit margins even lower . Aviation Tourism activities made money individual margins collective volumes , thus , inherently incompatible concept social distancing.Because COVID-19 pandemic , businesses realized meetings handled video calls , thus , movement business personnel restricted . still representatives fly conduct business , industry expect permanent drop revenue sector.Moving supply side , Aviation Tourism industries face strong disruptions supply chain . industry leisure expense , manufacturing many supporting equipment like adventure sports gears even parts planes stopped . drop demand , going tough get supply chain back . Furthermore , workers afraid show jobs high risk contracting virus due exposure multiple customers different geographies.Let us see examples industry done March April.Airbnbs ( America ) : bookings vanished mid-March . Property owners bought leased real estate list app severely affected . sharing economy , like Uber , Lyft DoorDash taken hit Airbnb worse expenses include cleaning services , interior design ( one-time spend ) , property maintenance fixed costs.Thus , pandemic revenue gone costs exist . people depend owner ’ rental income made problem worse.Hosts usually decide cancellation policy , extreme circumstances , like one , company decided override existing policies ( many ’ strict ) gave full refund guests . company got $ 2 billion loan helped owners , financially paying 25 % cancelled bookings capping 5k/host . helped hosts getting eligible small business loans avoid eviction.Thankfully , properties cause housing crisis , breakdown could cause strain lenders undermine property values ( want sell avoid foreclosure defaulting loans ) . AirDNA states listing split-up Airbnb : 33 % list single property , 33 % owners list 2-24 properties , 33 % hosts 25+ properties.Some state governments America banned short-term rentals . hurt Airbnb owners people looking quarantine outside homes near relatives could ’ generated revenues.So , hosts ? Many discounting units looking long-term tenants ( 12 months ) . Many planning apply small-business loan , seek forbearance banks , find long-term tenants independently Airbnb sell property.Reluctance workers comeback work ( America ) : According Wall Street Journal , roughly half US workers stand earn Coronavirus rather work pay cheques . However , must noted gotten money due bureaucratical issues.This complicates reopening workers ’ want come back expose virus earn less . businesses want workers come back small business loans forgiven , business reopen . However , money consumer ’ pockets means economy expected rebound quickly businesses open . 40 million Americans unemployment benefits , majorly restaurant , hospitality , retail industries.Congress chose flat amount relief really time-consuming payments calibrated worker ’ lost wages . $ 600 federal payment corresponds $ 15/hours wage , 21 states follow $ 7.25/hours.Most workers ’ want sit home anxious get back work , right staying home smartest financial decision families.Workers ineligible unemployment benefits job made available . owners reluctant report workers authorities sever relationships employees may need later year tourism demand expected pick . Without income support , low-wage workers would likely seek jobs , including side hustles gig work , could expose households virus . Thus , according government , important give large stimulus economy.Coronavirus planes : Studies SARs suggested people sitting close infectious persons large risk . Combined , long journeys , passengers may take masks . Thus , risks transmission large airlines need focus figuring prevent transmission planes.Currently , airlines plan using self-cleaning material , long-lasting disinfectant , touchless lavatories , UV light disinfectant , antimicrobial coating frequently touched surfaces , cleaning flights.However , even efforts , 12 % people flying ( compared last year , time ) 27th May 2020.Aviation Tourism industries curse luxury expense thus , Coronavirus pandemic spread , entire industry jolted halt . one hardest-hit sectors adapt new normal wherein revenue levels unlikely match pre-COVID levels margins also reduced . However , bleak future , industry stay people travel , eventually vacation well .
